## Laravel Fleet Management System

This project is a Laravel-based Fleet Management System that allows users to manage bus bookings, seats, and trips. It includes features for checking available seats, booking seats, and managing trips and stations.


## Features

View available seats based on start and end stations.
Book seats for trips.
Manage trips, buses, and stations.
Integrated with MySQL for data storage.
Dockerized for easy development and deployment.

## Requirements
Docker & Docker Compose
PHP 8.2 or higher (included in the Docker image)
MySQL  (provided via Docker container)
Composer (included in the Docker image)

### Getting Started
These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine using Docker.

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/fleet-management.git
cd fleet-management

2. Install PHP dependencies

Run Composer to install the required PHP dependencies:

- composer install

3. Set up environment configuration
Duplicate the .env.example file to create a .env file. This file contains your environment-specific settings:

- cp .env.example .env
Then, update the .env file with your database credentials. For example:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=fleet_management
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

4. Generate the application key
Run the following Artisan command to generate your application key:
- php artisan key:generate

5. Set up the database
Create the database and run migrations to set up the necessary tables:

- php artisan migrate

Optionally, you can seed the database with some initial data:
- php artisan db:seed

### Running the Application
Start the local development server:

- php artisan serve
By default, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

### Testing
To run the tests for this application, use PHPUnit. To run all tests, use:

- php artisan test


### Docker Get Started

1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/fleet-management.git
- cd fleet-management

2. Build the Docker containers
This project uses Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup. To build the containers, run:
- docker-compose build
This will build the Laravel app and MySQL containers.


3. Start the Docker containers
To start the containers in detached mode (in the background), run:
- docker-compose up -d

4. Set up the Laravel application
Once the containers are running, you need to set up the Laravel app. Run the following commands inside the app container:
- docker-compose exec app bash
Now youâ€™re inside the app container. Run these commands to set up the application:

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Generate the Laravel application key
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations to set up the database
php artisan migrate

5. Access the application
Once the setup is complete, you can access the Laravel application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
6. Stopping the application
When you're done with the application, you can stop the containers by running:
- docker-compose down

### Project Structure

- **[app/](Contains the core application code (Controllers, Models, Services))**
- **[config](Configuration files for the Laravel application)**
- **[database](Database migrations and seeders)**
- **[docker-compose.yml](Docker Compose configuration for services like the app and database)**
- **[Dockerfile]( Defines the PHP environment and dependencies for the Laravel app)**
- **[.env](Environment configuration file used by Laravel (e.g., database credentials))**
- **[resources]( Views and resources (including assets like CSS, JavaScript))**
- **[routes](Defines the routes of the application)**
- **[tests](Contains the unit and feature tests.)**

## Testing

Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, make sure the containers are up and running, then execute the following command:
- docker-compose exec app bash
- php artisan test
This will run all the unit tests and display the results in your terminal.

Database Tests
Ensure that the database is correctly set up before running tests. The php artisan migrate command will create the necessary tables for you.
